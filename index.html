            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system 
            where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators 
            (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be <u>interlinked by hypertext,</u> 
            and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the WWW are transferred 
            via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users 
            by a software application called a web browser and are published 
            by a software application called a web server.
